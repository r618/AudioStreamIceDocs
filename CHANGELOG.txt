===========================================
1.4.0
-- updated dependencies/used libraries + added/replaced existing MPEG decoding library
-- cleaned up not needed support files
-- fixed some (soma.fm) radio image loading from link from stream tags
-- tags detected in streams are handled more efficiently - notification/event was previously emitted even for their non changed content -
-- iOS plugin uses `UnityBatchPlayerLoop()` to handle background audio mode by default now since it seems to be OK in latest (~U6000.1) version(s)

Demo application/scene:
-- demo app/scene has more responsive layout
-- added bunch of various online streaming formats/examples

Some servers don't produce continuos stream of all content/tracks, but finish each track individually instead before starting new one -
- this is currently problematic for Ogg/OPUS codec and is worked around in demo scene such that the stream is restarted in `OnPlaybackStopped` event after previous track is finished.
