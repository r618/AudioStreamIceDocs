1.4.0
-- updated dependencies/used libraries + added/replaced existing MPEG decoding library
-- cleaned up not needed support files
-- fixed some (soma.fm) radio image loading from link from stream tags
-- tags detected in streams are handled more efficiently - notification/event was previously emitted even for their non changed content -

Demo application/scene:
-- demo app/scene has more responsive layout
-- added bunch of various online streaming formats/examples

Some servers don't produce continuos stream of all content/tracks, but finish each track individually instead before starting new one -
- this is currently problematic for Ogg/OPUS codec and is worked around in demo scene such that the stream is restarted in `OnPlaybackStopped` event after previous track is finished.

===========================================
1.4.1
- fixed incorrect url resolving for local media/files (don't use HttpHandler for links/urls not pointing to network via "http"..)
- `Il2CppSetOptionAttribute` attributes used for IL2CPP builds are enabled by default - necessary setup steps on how to use them properly were added to initial import README doc
- submitted with Unity 2021.3.45f2
